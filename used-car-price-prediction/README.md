ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict used vehicle prices based on key features such as mileage, engine volume, manufacturing year, fuel type, and transmission type.

Dataset: 8,739 car listings with 10 variables
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression
Methods Used:
Data preprocessing (feature scaling, encoding, outlier detection)
Feature engineering (log transformations, polynomial features, interaction terms)
Model evaluation (Mean Absolute Error, RÂ² Score)
The final model, a Random Forest Regressor, achieved an MAE of 4,483, outperforming linear regression while capturing non-linear relationships in pricing. The project highlights practical 
ML applications for pricing optimization in the automotive market.
